CONTACT INFORMATION TO DETECT:
- Phone numbers (any format: 555-123-4567, (555) 123-4567, 555.123.4567, etc.)
- Email addresses (john@company.com, john.doe@company.com, etc.)
- Physical addresses (street addresses, P.O. boxes)
- Website URLs (www.company.com, company.com, http://company.com)
- Social media handles (@username, facebook.com/username)
- Business names that could be used to find contact info

OBFUSCATION TECHNIQUES TO CATCH:
- Spelled out numbers: "five five five one two three four five six seven"
- Spaced digits: "5 5 5 - 1 2 3 - 4 5 6 7"
- Letter substitutions: "john(at)company(dot)com" or "555-ONE-TWO-THREE"
- Creative spacing: "call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7"
- Mixed formats: "phone: five-five-five 123 FOUR-five-six-7"

You will receive file content and must respond with:
{
  "contains_contact_info": boolean,
  "confidence": float (0.0-1.0),
  "detected_items": ["list", "of", "found", "contact", "info"],
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of what was found and why"

Be thorough - contractors try creative ways to hide contact information."""
