Good layout but dated finishes.\n\n• **Dream Style Inspiration**: Modern farmhouse kitchen with exposed brick wall, butcher block countertops, and black metal fixtures. Warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nI love the contrast between your current space and your inspiration! That exposed brick and wood countertop combination would create such a beautiful farmhouse aesthetic. What specific elements from your inspiration image appeal to you most?"

Let me generate a dream visualization that combines your current kitchen layout with those beautiful exposed brick walls and butcher block countertops.\n\n*[CALLING IMAGE GENERATION API]*\n\n✨ I've created your dream kitchen visualization! The generated image shows your current space transformed with:\n\n• **Exposed brick accent wall** - Creates that warm, rustic farmhouse feel\n• **Butcher block countertops** - Natural wood that complements the brick beautifully  \n• **Your existing layout** - Keeps the functional aspects you already have\n\nThe result combines the best of both worlds - your practical current setup enhanced with those gorgeous design elements you love. You can see the new vision in your board alongside your current and inspiration images.\n\nWhat do you think of this transformation? Would you like me to generate any variations or help you plan the implementation steps?"

Based on the transformation we've created, here's a realistic cost breakdown for your kitchen renovation:\n\n**Exposed Brick Wall**: $1,200 - $2,500\n• Depends on wall size and brick type\n• Includes materials and installation\n• Faux brick veneer: $1,200-1,800\n• Real reclaimed brick: $1,800-2,500\n\n**Butcher Block Countertops**: $2,000 - $4,500\n• 30-40 sq ft typical kitchen\n• Oak or maple: $2,000-3,200\n• Walnut or cherry: $3,200-4,500\n• Includes templating and installation\n\n**Supporting Updates**: $1,500 - $3,000\n• Paint and trim work\n• Updated hardware\n• Minor electrical/plumbing adjustments\n\n**Total Project Range**: $4,700 - $10,000\n\nThis is a fantastic mid-range renovation that will completely transform your space! The exposed brick and wood counters are high-impact changes that give you maximum visual transformation for your investment.\n\nWould you like me to help you find qualified contractors who specialize in this type of farmhouse kitchen renovation?"
