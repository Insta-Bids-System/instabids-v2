## 🧠 DEEPAGENTS ARCHITECTURE

### **One Main Agent with 5 Specialized Subagents**

The DeepAgents framework creates **ONE main orchestrator** that intelligently delegates to specialized subagent configurations (not separate files) based on conversation context.

```python
# Main DeepAgents Agent
_agent = create_deep_agent(
    tools=tools,                    # All 8 tools available
    instructions=_instructions(),   # Main agent instructions  
    subagents=[                     # 5 subagent configurations
        identity_subagent,
        research_subagent, 
        radius_subagent,
        projects_subagent,
        account_subagent
    ],
)
```

### **5 Subagent Configurations**

#### 1. **Identity Subagent** 🔍
```python
identity_subagent = {
    "name": "identity-agent", 
    "description": "Confirm business existence using minimal Google Business lookup.",
    "prompt": "You confirm that a business exists using validate_company_exists..."
}
```
- **Purpose**: Validate business exists via Google Business lookup
- **Tools**: `validate_company_exists()` ONLY
- **Triggered When**: Main agent needs business verification (company extraction handled by main AI)
- **🎯 ZERO HARDCODING**: Main agent uses pure AI to understand company names

#### 2. **Research Subagent** 📊
```python
research_subagent = {
    "name": "research-agent", 
    "description": "Perform verified research and stage profile data.",
    "prompt": "CRITICAL WORKFLOW - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY:\n1. Use research_company_basic..."
}
```
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive web research, GPT-4o field extraction, profile staging
- **Tools**: `research_company_basic()`, `extract_contractor_profile()`, `stage_profile()`
- **Triggered When**: Company identity confirmed and deep research needed

#### 3. **Radius Subagent** 📍
```python
radius_subagent = {
    "name": "radius-agent",
    "description": "Collect services/radius preferences and intelligently suggest contractor types.",
    "prompt": "Collect search radius and use GPT-4o to analyze business profile..."
}
```
- **Purpose**: Update service radius and intelligently suggest additional contractor types
- **Tools**: `enhanced_radius_agent()` with GPT-4o analysis, `intelligent_contractor_type_analysis()`
- **Triggered When**: User discusses service area or expanding services
- **Intelligence**: GPT-4o analyzes complete business profile to suggest relevant contractor types from ALL 308 database types (no hardcoded rules)

#### 4. **Projects Subagent** 🔎 (BSA INTEGRATED)
```python
projects_subagent = {
    "name": "projects-agent",
    "description": "Search available projects using BSA's proven bid search patterns.",
    "prompt": "Use search_projects_bsa_style with contractor ZIP and radius for superior results..."
}
```
- **Purpose**: Find matching bid cards using BSA's superior search implementation
- **Tools**: `search_projects_bsa_style()` - Direct copy of BSA's proven patterns
- **Performance**: 1.9 seconds, finds 18+ bid cards with accurate radius filtering  
- **Integration**: Uses BSA's exact database queries with contractor type matching
- **Triggered When**: User asks about available projects or work opportunities

#### 5. **Account Subagent** 👤
```python
account_subagent = {
    "name": "account-agent",
    "description": "Create contractor account only after explicit consent.",
    "prompt": "ONLY proceed if the user explicitly consents to account creation..."
}
```
- **Purpose**: Create official contractor accounts with user consent
- **Tools**: `create_account_from_staging()`
- **Triggered When**: User explicitly agrees to create an account

### **How DeepAgents Intelligent Selection Works**

Unlike hardcoded flows, DeepAgents uses **LLM reasoning** to select subagents:

```
User: "I run JM Holiday Lighting in Fort Lauderdale"
↓
Main Agent analyzes: "This mentions a company name and location"
↓
Intelligently selects: IDENTITY-AGENT
↓
Executes: extract_company_info() + validate_company_exists()
↓
Natural response: "Great! I found JM Holiday Lighting. Let me research your business..."
```

```
User: "What outdoor lighting projects are available in the 33442 area?"
↓
Main Agent analyzes: "User wants to see available work in specific ZIP"
↓ 
Intelligently selects: PROJECTS-AGENT
↓
Executes: find_matching_projects() with ZIP radius search
↓
Natural response: "Here are 3 outdoor lighting projects in the 33442 area..."
```

## 💾 MEMORY SYSTEM (FULLY OPERATIONAL)

### **Persistent Conversation Memory**
- **contractor_lead_id**: Unique identifier for cross-session memory
- **unified_conversation_memory**: Database table storing conversation state
- **Automatic restoration**: "Welcome back!" with complete context

### **Memory Fields Persisted**
```python
{
    "messages": [],              # Complete conversation history
    "company_name": "...",       # Extracted business identity
    "contractor_profile": {},    # Business details, services, location  
    "research_findings": {},     # Google Business data, website analysis
    "subagent_discoveries": {},  # All subagent findings and actions
    "onboarding_progress": {},   # Conversation state and completion
    "session_metadata": {}      # Timestamps, corrections, tracking
}
```

## 🤖 INTELLIGENT CONTRACTOR TYPE ANALYSIS (NEW)

### **GPT-4o Powered Business Intelligence**
The radius subagent now uses **GPT-4o to intelligently analyze** contractor business profiles and suggest additional contractor types - **NO hardcoded rules**.

### **How It Works**
1. **Reads Business Profile**: Analyzes company name, services, specialties, years in business, competitive advantages
2. **Understands Context**: GPT-4o understands what the business actually does from descriptions
3. **Sees All 308 Types**: Has access to complete contractor type database (ALL 308 types shown to GPT-4o)
4. **Makes Smart Suggestions**: Suggests logical expansions based on business evidence
5. **Conversational**: Generates questions like "Are you also a landscape lighting installer?"

### **Example: JM Holiday Lighting Analysis**
```
Input: JM Holiday Lighting, Inc.
- Services: Holiday lighting, Event lighting, LED installations
- 20 years experience, serves commercial and residential

GPT-4o Intelligent Suggestions:
1. Landscape Lighting Installer (112) - HIGH confidence
   "Natural progression from holiday lighting"
   
2. Low Voltage Lighting Installer (113) - HIGH confidence  
   "LED lighting aligns with low voltage systems"
   
3. Smart Home Integrator (71) - MEDIUM confidence
   "Leverage electrical skills for smart lighting"
```

### **Key Improvements**
- **No Manual Mapping**: Pure AI intelligence - NO hardcoded rules like "Holiday Lighting -> Electrical"
- **Context Aware**: Won't suggest Electrical if contractor already does electrical work
- **Full Visibility**: GPT-4o sees ALL 308 contractor types (complete database visibility)
- **Business Logic**: Suggestions based on actual business capabilities from profile analysis
- **Intelligent Reasoning**: Uses business summary, services, certifications, and competitive advantages
