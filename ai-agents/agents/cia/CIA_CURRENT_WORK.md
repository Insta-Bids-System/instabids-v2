# CIA Agent - Current Work Tracking
**Last Updated**: August 29, 2025
**Purpose**: Track current development, testing, and issues for CIA agent

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK
**Status**: 🚧 IMPLEMENTING PROFILE-BASED ARCHITECTURE (Landing vs App)

### What We're Building:
- **Landing Profile**: Anonymous homepage chat → creates potential_bid_cards with session_id
- **App Profile**: Logged-in dashboard chat → full features, user_id, history loading
- **Single Agent**: One CIA agent, two different behaviors based on profile
- **Separate Endpoints**: `/api/cia/landing/stream` and `/api/cia/app/stream`

### Implementation Plan:
1. Create separate endpoints for landing vs app
2. Add profile parameter to agent.py handle_conversation() 
3. Filter tools based on profile (landing = extraction only, app = full CRUD)
4. Gate memory loading (landing = no history, app = full context)
5. Adjust prompts for each profile experience

### Previously Completed:
- ✅ Cleaned directory structure (removed 7 unused files)
- ✅ Fixed memory integration (using database_simple.py) 
- ✅ Restored conversation continuity
- ✅ Fixed OpenAI API key in Docker
- ✅ Analyzed all 12 endpoints (found 9 unused)
- ✅ Created system integration documentation

## 🧪 TEST STATUS

### Latest Test Results
```bash
# Last run: August 29, 2025
python tests/cia/test_conversation_continuity.py
✅ PASS - 3-turn conversation with context preservation
```

### Tests Available
- `test_conversation_continuity.py` - Multi-turn memory test ✅ PASSING
- `test_unified_cia_agent.py` - Integration test ✅ PASSING

## 🔧 KNOWN ISSUES
- None currently (all major issues resolved)

## 📋 NEXT TASKS
1. [ ] Add streaming responses for better UX
2. [ ] Implement photo upload handling for RFI system
3. [ ] Add conversation branching for complex projects
4. [ ] Performance optimization (current: 2-3s response time)

## 🏗️ RECENT CHANGES

### August 29, 2025
- Moved 7 unused files to `archive/unused/`
- Fixed database schema issues (user_id → created_by)
- Restored conversation continuity
- Updated Docker API key configuration
- Created this tracking document

## 💡 WORKING NOTES

### Key Insights
- Agent uses UNIFIED_PROMPT_FINAL.py, NOT prompts.py
- Memory via database_simple → database.py → unified_conversations
- Tool calling happens automatically via OpenAI function calling
- Bid cards update in real-time via PotentialBidCardManager

### Common Commands
```bash
# Run tests
docker-compose exec instabids-backend python tests/cia/test_conversation_continuity.py

# Test agent directly
docker-compose exec instabids-backend python -c "
from agents.cia.agent import CustomerInterfaceAgent
agent = CustomerInterfaceAgent()
# test code here
"

# Check logs
docker logs instabids-instabids-backend-1 --tail 100
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. ALWAYS test in Docker environment (has API keys)
2. NEVER import from archive/unused/ files
3. UPDATE this file when starting new work
4. KEEP README.md in sync with changes
