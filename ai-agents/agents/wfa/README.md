    H --> I[Form Submission]
    I --> J[Success Verification]
```

## Intelligent Form Analysis

### Form Discovery Process
1. **Homepage Analysis**: Scans main page for embedded forms
2. **Contact Link Detection**: Finds contact, quote, estimate pages
3. **Multi-Page Scanning**: Analyzes up to 3 contact pages
4. **Form Field Mapping**: Identifies purpose of each form field
5. **Quality Assessment**: Scores forms for completeness and relevance

### Field Purpose Detection
```python
def _determine_field_purpose(self, field_info):
    # Analyzes field names, IDs, placeholders, labels
    patterns = {
        "name": ["name", "fname", "first", "last"],
        "email": ["email", "e-mail", "mail"],
        "phone": ["phone", "tel", "mobile", "cell"],
        "company": ["company", "business"],
        "message": ["message", "comments", "description", "project"],
        "service": ["service", "type", "category"],
        "budget": ["budget", "price", "cost"],
        "timeline": ["timeline", "when", "date"]
    }
```

### Form Quality Scoring System
```python
def _calculate_form_score(self, form_data):
    score = 0
    purposes = [f["purpose"] for f in form_data["fields"]]
    
    if "name" in purposes: score += 20
    if "email" in purposes: score += 25  
    if "phone" in purposes: score += 20
    if "message" in purposes: score += 25
    if "service" in purposes: score += 10
    
    # Penalties for overly complex forms
    if len(form_data["fields"]) > 10: score -= 20
    
    # Bonus for contact page URLs
    if "contact" in form_data["page_url"].lower(): score += 15
    
    return max(0, score)
```

## Professional Message Generation

### InstaBids-Branded Messaging
```python
def _generate_contact_message(self, bid_data, bid_card):
    # Professional company representation
    # Direct bid card URL inclusion
    # Project-specific details
    # Clear call-to-action
    
    message = f"""
    We represent a homeowner who is ready to move forward with the right contractor. 
    You can view complete project details, photos, and specifications here:
    
    {bid_card_url}
    
    We're contacting top-rated contractors in the area and would like to include 
    you in our bidding process.
    
    Best regards,
    Sarah Johnson

    "phone": "(407) 555-0199",  # Company phone
    "company": "Instabids Marketplace",
    "message": professional_message_with_bid_card_url
}
```

## Form Submission Process

### Intelligent Form Filling
```python
def fill_contact_form(self, contractor_lead, bid_card, form_info=None):
    # Navigate to best form page
    # Prepare professional project data
    # Fill fields based on detected purposes
    # Handle different input types (text, select, radio, checkbox)
    # Submit form with professional messaging
    # Verify submission success
```

### Field Type Handling

    # Click submit button
    # Wait for response
    # Check for success indicators:
    success_patterns = [
        "thank you", "thanks", "success", "received",
        "we'll be in touch", "submitted", "confirmation"
    ]
    # Verify form submission completed
```

## Browser Automation Features

### Headless Browser Management
```python
def start_browser(self):
    playwright = sync_playwright().start()
    self.browser = playwright.chromium.launch(
        headless=self.headless,
        args=["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"]
    )
    self.context = self.browser.new_context(
        viewport={"width": 1920, "height": 1080},
        user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
    )
```

    # Process multiple contractors in single browser session
    # Track success/failure rates
    # Implement delays between submissions
    # Comprehensive result reporting
```
