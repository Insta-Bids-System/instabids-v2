## Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Integrations
1. **CIA Agent** - Tool integrated and working with confidence scoring

3. **BSA Search** - Using new categories for contractor matching
4. **Frontend Display** - Normalized tags showing correctly

### ‚ùå Pending Integrations
1. **JAA Agent** - Plan exists but not implemented
   - Needs categorization node in workflow
   - Should populate service_category, project_type, project_description

## Required Actions

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)
1. **Add synonyms for Replacement category** (81 items)
   - Critical for proper categorization
   - Can copy/modify from Installation and Repair patterns

2. **Add synonyms for Emergency category** (25 items)  
   - High-priority projects need proper matching
   - Include urgency variations

3. **Add synonyms for Maintenance category** (30 items)
   - Important for recurring service contracts
   - Include schedule variations

### SHORT TERM (Next 2 Weeks)
4. **Complete Installation synonyms** (45 remaining)
5. **Complete Repair synonyms** (66 remaining)
6. **Implement JAA categorization**

### MEDIUM TERM (Month)
7. **Add synonyms for service categories** (Ongoing, Labor Only, Consultation)
8. **Add synonyms for specialty categories** (Events, Rentals, Lifestyle, Professional, AI)
9. **Create automated testing for all 449 project types**

## Recommendation

**Priority Focus**: Complete synonym mappings for the 5 core categories (Installation, Repair, Replacement, Maintenance, Emergency) which cover 80% of typical projects. These 300 project types are critical for production success.

**Quick Win**: The Replacement category can largely reuse synonyms from Installation/Repair with word substitutions ("install" ‚Üí "replace", "fix" ‚Üí "replace").
