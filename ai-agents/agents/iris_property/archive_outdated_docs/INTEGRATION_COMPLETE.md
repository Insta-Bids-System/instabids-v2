# IRIS Agent Integration - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully connected all missing integration points in the IRIS agent with minimal code changes.

## Changes Made (3 files, ~100 lines)

### 1. **image_workflow.py** 
- Made `_store_images` method async
- Added `_create_repair_items` method to create repair items after photo storage
- Checks `maintenance_potential > 0.3` to determine if repairs needed
- Creates `potential_bid_cards` and `repair_items` records

### 2. **agent.py**
- Connected repair item methods to actual database operations
- `add_repair_item()` - Creates repair items in database
- `update_repair_item()` - Updates existing repair items
- `delete_repair_item()` - Removes repair items
- `list_repair_items()` - Lists all items for a bid card
- Made image workflow call async

### 3. **photo_manager.py**
- No changes needed - room detection already working correctly
- Queries `property_rooms` table to find matching room

## Database Flow

```
User uploads photo
    ↓
Room Detection (GPT-4 Vision)
    ↓
Store to property_photos with room_id
    ↓
Analyze for maintenance issues
    ↓
If issues detected (maintenance_potential > 0.3)
    ↓
Create/update potential_bid_card
    ↓
Create repair_items linked to bid card
    ↓
UI displays via UnifiedRepairsProjects component
```

## Connected Tables
- `properties` - User properties
- `property_rooms` - Room definitions (NOW CONNECTED)
- `property_photos` - Photo storage with room assignments
- `potential_bid_cards` - Draft project cards (NOW CONNECTED)
- `repair_items` - Individual repair items (NOW CONNECTED)

## API Endpoints Working
- `POST /api/iris/repair-items` - Create repair item
- `PUT /api/iris/repair-items/{id}` - Update repair item
- `DELETE /api/iris/repair-items/{id}` - Delete repair item
- `GET /api/iris/repair-items/{bid_card_id}` - List repair items

## Testing Results
✅ All imports working
✅ All methods exist and connect to database
✅ Repair item creation integrated into photo workflow
✅ Room detection queries correct table
✅ No placeholder code remaining

## Next Steps for Frontend
The backend is ready. Frontend component `UnifiedRepairsProjects.tsx` can now:
1. Call `/api/iris/repair-items/{bid_card_id}` to get repair items
2. Display repair items grouped by trade type
3. Allow users to select items to bundle into projects
4. Convert to official bid cards

## Performance Impact
- Minimal - only adds 1-2 database queries per photo upload
- Async operations prevent blocking
- Only creates repairs when issues detected (threshold: 0.3)
