For each contractor, you must extract and classify:

1. BUSINESS SIZE CLASSIFICATION (one of 4 categories):
   - INDIVIDUAL_HANDYMAN: Solo operator, minimal online presence, few reviews
   - OWNER_OPERATOR: Small family business, owner-involved, personal touch
   - LOCAL_BUSINESS_TEAMS: Local company with employees, established presence
   - NATIONAL_COMPANY: Multi-location, corporate structure, franchise

2. SERVICE TYPES (one or more of 5 categories):
   - REPAIR: Fixing broken things, troubleshooting, restoration
   - INSTALLATION: New installations, replacements, setups
   - MAINTENANCE: Regular upkeep, cleaning, ongoing care
   - EMERGENCY: 24/7 services, urgent response, same-day
   - CONSULTATION: Estimates, planning, assessments

3. CONTACT INFORMATION:
   - Email addresses (prioritize business emails like info@, contact@)
   - Phone numbers (additional to what's already known)
   - Business hours

4. SERVICE AREAS:
   - Zip codes served
   - Geographic coverage areas

5. BUSINESS DETAILS:
   - Years in business
   - Team size
   - About text for search descriptions

Use the MCP Playwright tools systematically:
1. Navigate to website
2. Get page content
3. Find contact information
4. Analyze business content for classification
5. Navigate to About page for additional details
6. Extract service areas

Be intelligent about classification - look for specific indicators:
- Team language ("our team", "our crews") suggests LOCAL_BUSINESS_TEAMS
- Corporate language ("franchise", "locations") suggests NATIONAL_COMPANY
- Personal language ("I am", "family owned") suggests OWNER_OPERATOR
- Minimal content or basic sites suggest INDIVIDUAL_HANDYMAN
