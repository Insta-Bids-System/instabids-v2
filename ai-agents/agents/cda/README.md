# CDA (Contractor Discovery Agent) - OpenAI GPT-4 Enhanced

## Overview
The Contractor Discovery Agent uses OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent contractor discovery and matching. It implements a sophisticated 3-tier sourcing system with AI-powered analysis to find the most qualified contractors for each project based on deep understanding of customer requirements and preferences.

## Core Technology
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent contractor analysis and matching
- **Database**: Supabase for contractor storage and querying
- **Web Search**: Google Places API and web scraping
- **Scoring System**: Multi-factor contractor evaluation
- **3-Tier Architecture**: Internal → Re-engagement → External sourcing

## Core Classes

### `ContractorDiscoveryAgent` (Primary Implementation)
```python
class ContractorDiscoveryAgent:
    """CDA - 3-tier contractor sourcing system"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.tier1_matcher = Tier1Matcher(self.supabase)
        self.tier2_reengagement = Tier2Reengagement(self.supabase)
        self.tier3_scraper = Tier3Scraper(self.supabase)
        self.web_search_agent = WebSearchContractorAgent(self.supabase)
        self.scorer = ContractorScorer()
```

**Key Methods:**
- `discover_contractors()` - Main 3-tier discovery workflow
- `get_discovery_cache()` - Retrieval of cached results
- `_calculate_match_score()` - Contractor scoring algorithm

### Duplicate Implementations Found ⚠️

#### Multiple CDA Versions
1. **`agent.py`** - ⭐ **PRIMARY VERSION** (Used in production)
2. **`agent_v2.py`** - Enhanced with intelligence features
3. **`agent_v2_optimized.py`** - Performance optimization focus

**Recommendation**: Consolidate features from v2 versions into primary agent.py

## Agent Interactions

### Input Sources
- **JAA Agent**: Completed bid cards with project requirements
- **Orchestrator**: Campaign triggers and timing requests
- **Database**: Existing contractor profiles and history

### Output Destinations

## 3-Tier Discovery Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Bid Card Input] --> B[Tier 1: Internal Matching]
    B --> C{Enough Contractors?}
    C -->|No| D[Tier 2: Re-engagement]
    C -->|Yes| H[Score & Rank]
    D --> E{Enough Contractors?}
    E -->|No| F[Tier 3: External Search]
    E -->|Yes| H
    F --> G[Web Search & Scraping]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Return Top Contractors]
```

## Tier 1: Internal Matching

### Database Query Strategy
```sql
SELECT * FROM contractors 
WHERE specialties @> ARRAY['kitchen remodeling']
AND ST_DWithin(location, project_location, 25000)  -- 25km radius
AND tier IN (1, 2)
AND availability_status = 'available'
ORDER BY tier ASC, rating DESC, distance ASC
```

### Matching Criteria
- **Specialty Match**: Exact trade matching required
- **Geographic Proximity**: Distance-based scoring
- **Tier Level**: Prioritizes higher-tier contractors
- **Availability**: Only active, available contractors
- **Performance History**: Past project success rates

## Tier 2: Re-engagement

### Target Criteria
- Previously active contractors who went inactive
- Good historical performance (4+ star ratings)
- Specializes in required trade
- Within service area
- Last active within 6 months

### Re-engagement Strategy
- Personalized outreach messages
- Incentive offers for returning
- Project-specific opportunities
- Streamlined re-onboarding process

## Tier 3: External Web Search

### Web Search Agent Integration
```python
class WebSearchContractorAgent:
    """Discovers contractors via Google Places API and web scraping"""
    
    def discover_contractors_for_bid(self, bid_card_id, needed_count):
        # Google Places API search
        # Web directory scraping
        # Data extraction and validation
        # Automatic contractor profile creation
```

### Discovery Sources
- **Google Places API**: Local business listings
- **Angie's List**: Professional contractor directory
- **HomeAdvisor**: Contractor marketplace
- **Yelp Business**: Local service providers
- **BBB Directory**: Better Business Bureau listings

### Data Extraction
- Company name and contact information  
- Specialties and services offered
- Location and service areas
- Reviews and ratings data
- Website and social media links
- License and insurance information

## Contractor Scoring Algorithm

### Multi-Factor Scoring System
```python
def calculate_match_score(contractor, project_requirements):
    score = 0
    
    # Specialty matching (25 points max)
    if exact_specialty_match:
        score += 25
    elif related_specialty:
        score += 15
    
    # Distance scoring (20 points max)
    if distance < 5_miles:
        score += 20
    elif distance < 15_miles:
        score += 15
    elif distance < 25_miles:
        score += 10
    
    # Tier level (20 points max)
    tier_scores = {1: 20, 2: 15, 3: 10}
    score += tier_scores.get(contractor.tier, 5)
    
    # Rating (15 points max)
    score += min(contractor.rating * 3, 15)
    
    # Availability (10 points max)
    if contractor.availability == 'available':
        score += 10
    elif contractor.availability == 'limited':
        score += 5
    
    # Performance history (10 points max)
    success_rate = contractor.successful_projects / contractor.total_projects
    score += success_rate * 10
    
    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100
```

### Scoring Factors
- **Specialty Match** (25%): Exact trade vs related trades
- **Geographic Distance** (20%): Proximity to project location
- **Tier Level** (20%): Contractor quality tier (1=best)
- **Customer Rating** (15%): Average review scores
- **Availability** (10%): Current capacity status
- **Performance History** (10%): Past project success rate

## Caching & Performance

### Discovery Cache System
```python
# Results cached per bid card for 24 hours
cache_record = {
    "bid_card_id": bid_card_id,
    "tier_1_matches": [],
    "tier_2_matches": [],
    "tier_3_sources": [],
    "discovery_status": "completed",
    "total_contractors_found": count,
    "processing_time_ms": time
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Tier 1 Query Time**: < 500ms for database queries
- **Tier 2 Analysis**: < 1 second for re-engagement scoring
- **Tier 3 Web Search**: 3-5 seconds for external discovery
- **Total Discovery Time**: 5-8 seconds end-to-end
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 85% for repeated queries
