# COMPLETE CIA SYSTEM ANALYSIS
## The Truth About Prompts, Tools, and Database

Generated: August 27, 2025

## üîç THE CURRENT SITUATION

### 1. WHY ARE THERE 2 PROMPTS?

**SYSTEM_PROMPT** (2,125 chars):
- Created as "simplified" version
- HAS tool instructions: "Call update_bid_card AS SOON as you identify any project information"
- Focuses on extraction priorities
- Clean, direct, tool-focused

**OLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT** (12,289 chars):
- Original full business logic
- Has 12 Key Data Points system
- Has group bidding (15-25% savings)
- Has emergency handling
- NO TOOL INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL!

**WHAT'S BEING USED NOW:**
```python
# agent.py line 419-423
from agents.cia.prompts import OLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT
base_prompt = OLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT  # NO tool instructions!
```

**PROBLEM**: Using the prompt WITHOUT tool instructions but the tool still works because it's defined in the tools array!

## üìä WHAT ACTUALLY EXISTS IN THE SYSTEM

### TOOL DEFINITION (agent.py)
19 fields defined in update_bid_card tool:
```
1. project_type ‚Üí maps to primary_trade
2. service_type ‚Üí Installation/Repair/Ongoing/etc
3. project_description ‚Üí maps to user_scope_notes
4. budget_context ‚Üí research stage
5. budget_range_min/max ‚Üí dollar amounts
6. urgency_level ‚Üí emergency/urgent/flexible
7. estimated_timeline ‚Üí when needed
8. timeline_flexibility ‚Üí boolean
9. zip_code ‚Üí location
10. eligible_for_group_bidding ‚Üí boolean
11. property_area ‚Üí single family/condo
12. room_location ‚Üí which room
13. materials_specified ‚Üí preferences
14. special_requirements ‚Üí permits/HOA
15. contractor_size_preference ‚Üí small/large
16. quality_expectations ‚Üí budget/premium
17. email_address ‚Üí contact
```

### DATABASE REALITY CHECK
**SHOCKING DISCOVERY**: The potential_bid_cards table doesn't exist in the database!

```bash
# Checked database - NO potential_bid_cards table found!
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE '%bid%';
# Result: 0 rows
```

### HOW IT'S "WORKING" 
The PotentialBidCardManager (potential_bid_card_integration.py):
1. Maps tool fields to database fields
2. IGNORES fields that don't exist (lines 117-130)
3. Makes HTTP calls to backend endpoints
4. Backend probably creates/manages a different table structure

**Ignored fields** (not saved):
- property_type, property_size, current_condition
- location, location_context, contractor_requirements  
- urgency_reason, timeline_details
- uploaded_photos, photo_analyses
- phone_number

## üéØ THE REAL MAPPING

### What OLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT Wants (12 Key Data Points):
1. Project Type ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
2. Service Type ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it  
3. Project Description ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
4. Budget Context ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it (NOT dollars!)
5. Timeline/Urgency ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
6. Location ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it (zip_code)
7. Group Bidding ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
8. Property Context ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
9. Material Preferences ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
10. Images/Photos ‚ùå ‚Üí handled by IRIS
11. Special Requirements ‚úÖ ‚Üí tool has it
12. Intention Score ‚úÖ ‚Üí via contractor preferences

### What Tool Can Extract:
ALL 12 Key Data Points are covered!

### What Gets Saved:
UNKNOWN - depends on backend implementation since table doesn't exist in visible database

---

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION: UNIFIED PROMPT

```python
# MERGE both prompts for complete functionality
UNIFIED_CIA_PROMPT = """You are Alex, a friendly and intelligent project assistant for InstaBids.

[Include all OLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT content for business logic...]

## TOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
CRITICAL: Call the update_bid_card tool IMMEDIATELY when you learn ANY project information:
- Don't wait to collect everything
- Multiple calls are fine as you learn more  
- Update even partial information
- The user sees their bid card building in real-time!

When you identify project details, use the update_bid_card tool with these fields:
- project_type: What type of project (maps to primary_trade)
- service_type: Installation/Repair/Ongoing/Handyman/Appliance/Labor
- project_description: Detailed scope (maps to user_scope_notes)
- budget_context: Research stage NOT dollar amounts
- urgency_level: emergency/urgent/flexible/planning
- timeline_flexibility: Can timing be adjusted (boolean)
- zip_code: 5-digit zip code
- eligible_for_group_bidding: Good for neighbors (boolean)
[... rest of fields ...]

Remember: Every field you extract helps contractors provide better quotes!
"""

## üìù SUMMARY OF ISSUES

1. **PROMPT CONFUSION**:
   - Using OLD_SYSTEM_PROMPT (no tool instructions)
   - Should merge both prompts for complete functionality

2. **DATABASE MYSTERY**:
   - potential_bid_cards table not visible in database
   - Tool maps fields but many get ignored
   - Backend handling storage differently

3. **FIELD MAPPING**:
   - Tool has all 12 Key Data Points ‚úÖ
   - But some fields ignored during save
   - Group bidding field exists but save status unknown

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Create unified prompt combining business logic + tool instructions
2. **INVESTIGATE**: Where is bid card data actually stored?
3. **VERIFY**: Test actual database saves with real API calls
4. **FIX**: Ensure all critical fields (zip_code, group_bidding) are saved

The system IS extracting the right information but we need to verify it's actually being saved!
