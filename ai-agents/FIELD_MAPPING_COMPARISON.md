## ‚úÖ EXTRACTION SUCCESS RATE

From testing (test_bid_card_extraction.py):

### What Gets Extracted Successfully (9/10)

## üîç KEY FINDINGS

### Perfect Alignment
- The tool fields map 1:1 with the 12 Key Data Points
- All critical business logic is captured
- Group bidding (15-25% savings) is properly implemented

### Missing from Tool
1. **Phone Number** - DB has field but tool doesn't extract it
2. **Images** - Handled by IRIS agent separately (correct design)
3. **Name** - Not needed for bid card

### Business Logic Working
- ‚úÖ Group bidding detection and savings mentioned
- ‚úÖ Budget context without pushing for dollars
- ‚úÖ Urgency assessment based on WHY not just WHEN
- ‚úÖ All 12 Key Data Points being extracted

### Type Issues (FIXED)
- `timeline_flexibility` was string, now boolean ‚úÖ
- All other types match database schema

## üìä SUMMARY

**System Prompt Extraction Goals**: 12 Key Data Points
**Tool Definition Fields**: 19 fields covering all 12 points
**UI Display Fields**: 17 fields shown to user
**Extraction Success Rate**: 90% (missing only phone)

The system is properly aligned between:
- What the prompt tells the AI to extract (12 Key Data Points)
- What the tool can capture (19 fields)  
- What the UI displays (17 fields)
- What gets stored in the database (all fields)

The only gap is phone number extraction, which exists in the database but isn't defined in the tool parameters.
