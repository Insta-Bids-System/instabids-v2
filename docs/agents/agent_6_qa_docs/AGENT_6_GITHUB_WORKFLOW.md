# Agent 6: GitHub Workflow & Sync Strategy

## Current Mess
- 253 uncommitted changes
- Working directly on master (dangerous!)
- No clear commit organization

## My Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Organize Current Chaos
```bash
# Create safety branch first
git checkout -b agent-6-organize-chaos
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: backup all current work before organizing"

# Then organize into logical commits on proper branches
```

### Phase 2: Branch Strategy for Agents
Each agent gets their own branch pattern:
- `agent-1-frontend-[feature]`
- `agent-2-backend-[feature]`
- `agent-6-cleanup-[what]`

### Phase 3: My Git Maintenance Tasks
1. Daily: Check for uncommitted work
2. Weekly: Merge master into agent branches
3. Always: Keep commits small and focused

### Quick Commands I'll Use
```bash
# See what's messy
git status -s | wc -l

# Check who changed what
git diff --name-status

# Safe branch creation
git checkout -b agent-6-[task]
```
