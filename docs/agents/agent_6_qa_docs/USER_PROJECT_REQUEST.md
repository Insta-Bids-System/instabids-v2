# User Project Request - Docker MCP Integration
**Date**: August 4, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Agent**: Agent 6 (Codebase QA)

## 🚨 Problem Statement
User experiencing major issues with:
- Multiple frontends being created instead of using single `web/` directory
- Playwright MCP tool not showing main issues clearly during complex testing
- Cannot see frontend issues well due to complexity

## 🎯 Proposed Solution: Docker MCP
User suggests implementing QuantGeekDev/docker-mcp to solve coordination issues:
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/docker-mcp
- **Features**: Container management, real-time logs, multi-container stacks
- **Benefits**: Isolated environments, predictable ports, better testing

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Docker MCP Setup (30 minutes)
1. Clone and install Docker MCP server
2. Configure MCP connection in Claude
3. Test basic container operations

### Phase 2: Containerize Current Stack (1 hour)
1. Create Dockerfile for web frontend
2. Create Dockerfile for ai-agents backend
3. Create docker-compose.yml for full stack
4. Test containerized deployment

### Phase 3: Update Agent Coordination (30 minutes)
1. Update CLAUDE.md with Docker workflow
2. Test multi-agent frontend coordination
3. Validate Playwright testing in containers

## 🔄 Current Task Status
- **In Progress**: TypeScript type fixes (Phase 1 of error reduction)
- **Next**: Complete type fixes, then implement Docker MCP
- **Dependency**: User wants this done after current TypeScript work

## 📝 Notes for Agent 6
- Continue current TypeScript type cleanup
- Prepare Docker implementation plan
- Document benefits vs current workflow
- Test with existing frontend coordination issues

## ✅ Success Criteria
1. Single frontend workflow maintained
2. Playwright testing shows clear issues
3. No more accidental multiple frontend creation
4. Agent coordination improved with containers
5. Development velocity increased
