# Agent 1: Frontend Flow Systems
**Domain**: Initial Homeowner Experience → Bid Card Generation  
**Agent Identity**: Frontend Flow Specialist  
**Last Updated**: August 1, 2025 (CIA Conversational Improvements)

## 🎯 **YOUR DOMAIN - FRONTEND INITIAL FLOW**

You are **Agent 1** - responsible for the **first impression and intake flow** that captures homeowner project information and converts it into structured bid cards.

## ⚠️ **RECENT CRITICAL CHANGES** (August 1, 2025)

### CIA Conversational Improvements ✅ COMPLETE
- **CIA Conversational Flow**: Fixed pushy budget questioning - now explores planning stage naturally
- **Emergency Recognition**: CIA skips budget discussion for urgent situations (leaks, flooding)
- **Group Bidding Integration**: Actively mentions 15-25% savings for appropriate projects  
- **Memory Persistence**: Fixed context retention across conversation turns and projects
- **Budget Context Approach**: Uses "Have you gotten quotes before?" instead of "What's your budget?"
- **Value-First Messaging**: Always leads with InstaBids advantages before diving into project details

## 🚨 **NEW: BID TRACKING SYSTEM** (August 1, 2025) ✅ READY FOR YOUR INTEGRATION

### **CRITICAL**: Bid Cards Now Track Submitted Bids!
**What Changed**: Agent 2 built the missing piece - contractors can now submit bids back to the system!

**Your bid card display code needs to handle**:
- **New Status Values**: `collecting_bids`, `bids_complete` (in addition to `generated`)  
- **Bid Progress Tracking**: Show "3/5 bids received" progress
- **Submitted Bid Display**: Show actual contractor bids with amounts and timelines

### **Integration Required**
- **Read This**: `BID_TRACKING_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (created for you)
- **New API Available**: `from bid_submission_api import bid_api`
- **Key Method**: `bid_api.get_bid_card_summary(bid_card_id)` returns complete bid data

**Your Users Will Now See**:
- Real-time bid collection progress
- Actual contractor bids with pricing
- Automatic status updates when target reached

## 🗂️ **FILE OWNERSHIP - WHAT YOU CONTROL**

### **⚠️ REFACTORING UPDATE** (August 2, 2025)
**main.py has been refactored!** Your endpoints are now in modular router files:

### **✅ YOUR CODE** (Updated Structure)
```
# AI AGENTS
ai-agents/agents/cia/         # Customer Interface Agent (Claude Opus 4)
ai-agents/agents/jaa/         # Job Assessment Agent (Bid card generation)

# 🆕 NEW: ROUTER FILES (Your API Endpoints)
ai-agents/routers/cia_routes.py     # Your CIA chat endpoints
ai-agents/routers/homeowner_routes.py # Your homeowner UI endpoints
ai-agents/main.py                   # Now only ~100 lines (imports your routers)

# FRONTEND - MAIN WEB APP
web/src/components/chat/      # Chat UI components
web/src/pages/                # Page components
web/src/lib/storage.ts        # File upload handling

# FRONTEND - BID CARD DISPLAY
frontend/src/components/      # Specialized bid card components
└── BidCard.tsx              # Multi-channel bid card display

# TESTS
ai-agents/test_cia_*.py       # CIA tests
ai-agents/test_jaa_*.py       # JAA tests
```

### **🔧 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**
- **Work exactly as before** - Edit your agent files in `agents/cia/`, `agents/jaa/`
- **Add endpoints normally** - Put new API logic in `api/` files or ask where to add
- **Router files are internal** - System automatically organizes your endpoints
- **No workflow changes** - You don't need to touch router files directly
- **All API URLs identical** - Your frontend code works unchanged

### **✅ KEY FILES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST**
```
# Main Components
web/src/components/chat/CIAChat.tsx    # Your main chat interface
web/src/pages/HomePage.tsx             # Landing page with chat
ai-agents/agents/cia/agent.py          # CIA with Claude Opus 4
ai-agents/agents/jaa/agent.py          # JAA bid card generator
```

## 📋 **BID CARD DISPLAY SYSTEM** (Special Responsibility)

### **Why `frontend/` Directory Exists**
The `frontend/src/components/BidCard.tsx` is a **specialized component** that:
- **Renders bid cards for multiple channels** (web, email, SMS preview)
- **Provides rich link previews** when URLs are shared
- **Has 3 variants**:
  - `full`: Complete interactive web display
  - `preview`: Compact list/grid view
  - `email`: HTML-safe email rendering

### **Shared with Agent 2**
While you (Agent 1) generate bid cards via JAA, Agent 2 uses this component for:
- Email outreach to contractors
- SMS link previews
- Public bid card URLs (`https://instabids.com/bid-cards/{id}`)

**Key**: This component makes bid cards look professional across all platforms!

## 🚫 **BOUNDARIES - WHAT YOU DON'T TOUCH**

### **Other Agent Domains**
- **Agent 2**: Backend (CDA, EAA, WFA, orchestration)
- **Agent 3**: Homeowner UX (Iris, dashboards) 
- **Agent 4**: Contractor portal
- **Agent 5**: Marketing systems
