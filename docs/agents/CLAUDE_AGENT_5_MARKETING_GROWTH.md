## 🗂️ **FILE OWNERSHIP - WHAT YOU CONTROL** (Future Development)

### **⚠️ REFACTORING UPDATE** (August 2, 2025)
**main.py has been refactored!** When you build your endpoints, they'll go in modular router files:

### **🆕 YOUR CODE** (To Be Built)
```
# AI AGENTS
ai-agents/agents/affiliate/   # Affiliate marketing system
ai-agents/agents/marketing/   # Marketing automation
ai-agents/agents/social/      # Social & viral features
ai-agents/agents/gamification/ # Rewards & engagement

# 🆕 NEW: ROUTER FILES (Future - Your API Endpoints)
ai-agents/routers/marketing_routes.py   # Your marketing and growth endpoints
ai-agents/main.py                       # Will import your routers when built

# FRONTEND
web/src/components/referral/  # Referral system UI
web/src/components/ambassador/ # Brand ambassador portal
web/src/components/social/    # Social features
web/src/components/growth/    # Growth optimization

# API ENDPOINTS (Legacy structure - logic will be used by routers)
ai-agents/api/referral.py     # Referral system (logic used by router)
ai-agents/api/affiliate.py    # Affiliate program (logic used by router)
ai-agents/api/ambassador.py   # Ambassador program (logic used by router)
ai-agents/api/growth.py       # Growth analytics (logic used by router)

# TESTS
ai-agents/test_referral_*.py  # Referral tests
ai-agents/test_growth_*.py    # Growth tests
```

### **🔧 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**
- **Work exactly as before** - Build your marketing agents and APIs normally
- **Add endpoints normally** - Put new API logic in `api/` files or ask where to add
- **Router files are internal** - System will automatically organize your endpoints
- **No workflow changes** - You won't need to touch router files directly
- **All API URLs identical** - Your marketing APIs will work unchanged
