# Iris Three-Column System Update
**Date**: January 31, 2025
**Status**: FUNCTIONAL - Categorization Added ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Added Image Categorization Component
Created `ImageCategorizer.tsx` that allows users to tag images as:
- **Current Space** (Home icon - Blue)
- **Inspiration** (Sparkles icon - Purple) 
- **My Vision** (Target icon - Green)

### 2. ✅ Integrated Categorizer into BoardView
- Added hover controls on each image in grid view
- Users can now click icons to move images between columns
- Real-time updates to Supabase database

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Upload Experience
- Added category selector to ImageUploader
- Users can pre-select which column images should go to
- Uploads now save with proper tags

## How It Works Now

### Grid View
- Hover over any image to see categorization buttons
- Click Home/Sparkles/Target to move image to respective column
- Changes save instantly to database

### Column View
- Images automatically filter into correct columns based on tags
- Current Space: Shows images tagged 'current'
- Inspiration: Shows untagged images
- My Vision: Shows images tagged 'vision'

### Upload Flow
1. Click "Add Images"
2. Select category (Current Space / Inspiration / My Vision)
3. Drag & drop or select images
4. Images upload with pre-assigned tags

## What's Still Missing

### 1. Element Tagging
- Can't tag specific elements within images (e.g., "I like this countertop")
- No way to highlight or annotate parts of images

### 2. Vision Composition
- No AI mockup generation combining selected elements
- Can't merge elements from different images
- No automated vision board creation

### 3. CIA Handoff
- No "Start Project" button to send vision to CIA agent
- Missing data structure for vision-to-project conversion

### 4. Advanced Features
- No style analysis or conflict detection
- No budget estimation from selected elements
- No AI suggestions based on selections
