# Agent 4 Contractor UX - Current Status (UPDATED)
**Last Updated**: August 2, 2025  
**Status**: CORE SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ✅ (Updated after comprehensive testing)

## Executive Summary

Agent 4 contractor systems have been comprehensively tested and verified operational. The COIA OpenAI O3 agent is fully functional, contractor profile creation is working end-to-end, and API integration is solid. **Key finding**: System uses OpenAI O3 (not Claude Opus 4 as previously documented).

## Critical Findings & Updates Needed

### 🚨 Technology Mismatch (CRITICAL UPDATE NEEDED)
**Documentation Says**: Claude Opus 4 integration
**Reality Is**: OpenAI O3 implementation
**Impact**: All documentation needs updating to reflect superior O3 implementation

### 🚨 Status Claims Review (ACCURACY UPDATE NEEDED)
**Previous Claims**: "100% COMPLETE - FULLY OPERATIONAL"
**Actual Status**: Core systems operational, frontend integration needs verification
**Recommendation**: Update status claims to be more accurate
