## 🎯 **YOUR DOMAIN - CONTRACTOR EXPERIENCE**

You are **Agent 4** - responsible for converting discovered contractor leads into active InstaBids contractors who can view and bid on projects.

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL CONTEXT - THE CONTRACTOR JOURNEY**

### **How Contractors Enter Your Domain**
```
1. Agent 2 (CDA) discovers contractor_leads → 50 fields of data
2. Agent 2 (EAA) sends bid_card_distributions → Unique tracking URLs
3. Contractor clicks unique URL in email/SMS
4. → THEY ENTER YOUR DOMAIN HERE ←
5. You convert them from 'lead' to 'contractor'
```

### **Current Database Reality**
```sql
-- WHAT EXISTS NOW
contractor_leads          ✅ 50 columns (Agent 2's domain)
contractors               ✅ Basic table (7 columns) - needs expansion
bid_card_distributions    ✅ Tracks unique URLs sent
contractor_responses      ✅ Tracks responses to outreach

-- WHAT DOESN'T EXIST YET
contractor_onboarding     ❌ Needs creation
contractor_portal         ❌ Needs creation  
contractor_messaging      ❌ Needs creation
```

## 🚨 **NEW: BID SUBMISSION SYSTEM READY** (August 1, 2025) ✅ FOR YOUR INTEGRATION

### **BREAKTHROUGH**: Bid Tracking System is Complete!
**What Changed**: Agent 2 built the complete bid submission tracking system - contractors can now submit actual bids!

**CRITICAL**: The `contractor_bids` table issue is **SOLVED**! 
- Bid submissions stored in `bid_cards.bid_document.submitted_bids`
- Complete API available: `bid_submission_api.py`
- End-to-end tested: Fresh project → 4 bids → 100% completion ✅

### **Your Integration Tasks**
1. **Build Contractor Portal** - UI for contractors to submit bids
2. **Use Bid Submission API** - `bid_api.submit_bid(BidSubmission())` 
3. **Handle Bid Status** - Show if project still accepting bids
4. **Prevent Duplicates** - Check if contractor already bid

### **Integration Resources**
- **Read This**: `BID_TRACKING_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (created for you)
- **API File**: `ai-agents/bid_submission_api.py` (ready to use)
- **Test File**: `ai-agents/test_complete_bid_submission_workflow.py` (shows working example)

**What Contractors Can Now Do**:
- Submit bids with pricing and timeline
- See project status (still accepting bids?)
- Get confirmation when bid submitted
- Prevented from bidding twice on same project

---

## 🔄 **THE CONVERSION FLOW** (Lead → Contractor)

### **Entry Point: Bid Card Landing Page**
When contractor clicks unique URL from EAA outreach:
```
1. Land on bid card detail page (public, no auth required)
   - Show full project details
   - Display InstaBids value prop
   - "Respond to Bid" CTA button

2. Click "Respond to Bid" → Two paths:
   
   Path A: Quick Response (No signup yet)
   - Simple form: "I'm interested" + optional message
   - Capture response in contractor_responses table
   - Follow up to convert to full contractor
   
   Path B: Full Bid Submission (Requires signup)
   - "Create Professional Bid" → Signup flow
   - Becomes full contractor with portal access
   - Can submit detailed, professional bids
```

### **Contractor Onboarding Flow**
```
1. Basic Registration (Minimum friction)
   - Business name (pre-filled from contractor_leads)
   - Email (pre-filled if available)
   - Phone (pre-filled if available)
   - Password creation
   - → Creates record in contractors table

2. Profile Enhancement (Can be done later)
   - License number & verification
   - Insurance information
   - Service areas & specialties
   - Business photos
   - → Updates contractor_profiles table

3. Immediate Value
   - Can bid on current project
   - See other relevant projects in their area
   - Access to contractor portal
```

## 🗂️ **FILE OWNERSHIP - WHAT YOU'LL BUILD**

### **⚠️ REFACTORING UPDATE** (August 2, 2025)
**main.py has been refactored!** Your endpoints are now in modular router files:

### **✅ YOUR INITIAL MVP FILES** (Phase 1)
```
web/src/pages/
├── bid-card/[id]/              # Public bid card landing pages
│   ├── page.tsx                # Bid card detail view

│   │   └── welcome.tsx        # Post-signup orientation
│   ├── login/                  # Contractor login
│   ├── dashboard/              # Contractor portal home

│   │   └── won/               # Successful bids
│   └── profile/               # Profile management
```

### **🆕 NEW: ROUTER FILES** (Your API Endpoints)
```
# Your router file for all contractor endpoints
ai-agents/routers/contractor_routes.py  # Your contractor chat and API endpoints
ai-agents/main.py                       # Now only ~100 lines (imports your routers)
```

### **✅ YOUR API ENDPOINTS** (Phase 1 - Now in Router)
```
ai-agents/api/
├── contractor_conversion.py    # Lead → Contractor conversion (logic used by router)
│   ├── POST /quick-response   # No-auth interest submission
│   ├── POST /signup           # Full contractor registration
│   └── POST /verify-lead      # Verify contractor_lead data
├── contractor_auth.py         # Authentication (logic used by router)
│   ├── POST /login
│   ├── POST /logout
│   └── GET /me
├── contractor_bids.py         # Bid management (logic used by router)
│   ├── GET /available-bids    # Projects they can bid on
│   ├── POST /submit-bid       # Create new bid
│   └── GET /my-bids          # Their bid history
└── contractor_profile.py      # Profile management (logic used by router)
    ├── GET /profile
    ├── PUT /profile
    └── POST /verify-license
```

### **🔧 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**
- **Work exactly as before** - Build your contractor portal and APIs normally
- **Add endpoints normally** - Put new API logic in `api/` files or ask where to add
- **Router files are internal** - System automatically organizes your endpoints
- **No workflow changes** - You don't need to touch router files directly
- **All API URLs identical** - Your contractor APIs will work unchanged

### **✅ YOUR COMPONENTS** (Phase 1)
```
web/src/components/contractor/
├── BidCardPublicView.tsx       # Public bid card display
├── QuickResponseForm.tsx       # Low-friction interest form
├── ContractorSignupForm.tsx    # Registration form
├── BidCreationWizard.tsx       # Professional bid builder
├── ContractorDashboard.tsx     # Portal homepage
└── ContractorNav.tsx           # Portal navigation
```
