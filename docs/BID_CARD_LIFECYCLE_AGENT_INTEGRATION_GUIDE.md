## 🔗 **CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **For Frontend Development (Agent 1 & 3)**
```javascript
// Essential bid card data queries
GET /api/bid-cards/{id}/complete        // All lifecycle data
GET /api/bid-cards/{id}/progress        // Current status & metrics  
GET /api/bid-cards/{id}/bids           // Submitted bids
GET /api/bid-cards/{id}/timeline       // Complete activity log
```

### **For Backend Development (Agent 2)**
```python
# Core bid card operations
create_bid_card(cia_data) → bid_cards table
discover_contractors(bid_card_id) → contractor_leads
create_campaign(bid_card_id, contractors) → outreach_campaigns  
execute_outreach(campaign_id) → contractor_outreach_attempts
track_responses(bid_card_id) → contractor_responses
```

### **For Contractor Interface (Agent 4)**
```javascript
// Contractor-facing endpoints  
GET /api/contractor/bid-cards          // Available bid cards
GET /api/contractor/bid-cards/{id}     // Specific bid card details
POST /api/contractor/bids              // Submit bid
GET /api/contractor/responses          // Response history
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**

### **Must Exist Before Bid Card Creation**
1. **Homeowner Record**: `homeowners` table entry
2. **Project Context**: `project_contexts` or `agent_conversations`
3. **CIA Thread**: Valid `cia_thread_id` from conversation

### **Must Exist Before Contractor Outreach**
1. **Bid Card**: Valid `bid_cards` record with status "generated"
2. **Discovery Results**: `contractor_leads` from CDA discovery
3. **Campaign Plan**: `outreach_campaigns` with targeting strategy

### **Must Exist Before Bid Submission**
1. **Contractor Engagement**: Contractor must have viewed bid card
2. **Valid Bid Card**: Bid card status must be "collecting_bids"
3. **Target Not Met**: `bids_target_met` must be false

---

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS**

### **High-Frequency Operations**
- **Bid card views**: Contractors viewing bid cards (high volume)
- **Engagement events**: Click tracking and analytics (very high volume)
- **Email tracking**: Open/click/bounce events (high volume)  
- **Check-ins**: Campaign progress monitoring (frequent)

### **Database Optimization Needs**
```sql
-- Essential indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bid_cards_status ON bid_cards(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_bid_cards_created ON bid_cards(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_outreach_attempts_bid_card ON contractor_outreach_attempts(bid_card_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_engagement_events_bid_card ON bid_card_engagement_events(bid_card_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_contractor_leads_project_type ON contractor_leads(project_type);
```

### **Caching Strategy**
- **Discovery Cache**: `contractor_discovery_cache` for repeated searches
- **Engagement Summary**: `contractor_engagement_summary` for rollup metrics
- **Campaign Progress**: Real-time calculation with caching
