# BSA DeepAgents Migration PRD
**Product Requirements Document: Migrating BSA to DeepAgents Framework**  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Author**: Claude Code Agent  
**Status**: MIGRATION COMPLETE - Production Ready (August 15, 2025)

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **Project Goal**
Systematically migrate the current BSA (Bid Submission Agent) from simple OpenAI streaming to the sophisticated DeepAgents framework with 4 specialized sub-agents, while maintaining all existing API compatibility, memory integration, and performance characteristics.

### **Current State Analysis**
- **Current BSA**: `routers/bsa_stream.py` - Direct OpenAI streaming solution
- **Performance**: <5 second response times ✅ WORKING
- **Limitations**: No trade expertise, no bid card integration, no specialized intelligence
- **Memory**: Basic unified conversation saving
- **DeepAgents Framework**: `deepagents-system/` - Fully operational and available ✅ CONFIRMED

### **Target State**
- **New BSA**: DeepAgents-powered with 4 specialized sub-agents
- **Performance**: Maintain <5 second response times
- **Capabilities**: Trade expertise, bid card search, research, group bidding
- **Integration**: Full unified memory system compatibility
- **API**: 100% backward compatibility with existing endpoints

## 💾 **MEMORY & STATE INTEGRATION**

### **DeepAgents State + Unified Memory Integration**

#### **Current Memory Flow**
```python
# Current: bsa_stream.py saves to unified memory
await db.save_unified_conversation({
    "user_id": contractor_id,
    "session_id": session_id, 
    "agent_type": "BSA",
    "input_data": message,
    "response": response
})
```

#### **New DeepAgents Memory Flow**
```python
# New: DeepAgents state + unified memory integration
class BSADeepAgentState(DeepAgentState):
    # DeepAgents built-in state
    todos: NotRequired[list[Todo]]
    files: Annotated[NotRequired[dict[str, str]], file_reducer]
    
    # BSA-specific unified memory integration
    contractor_id: str
    session_id: str 
    unified_memory: NotRequired[dict[str, Any]]
    
    # Sub-agent communication tracking
    sub_agent_calls: NotRequired[list[dict]]
    bid_card_analysis: NotRequired[dict]
    market_research: NotRequired[dict]

# Memory integration functions
async def load_unified_context(state: BSADeepAgentState) -> BSADeepAgentState:
    """Load contractor context from unified memory into DeepAgents state"""
    context = await load_contractor_context_async(state["contractor_id"])
    state["unified_memory"] = context
    return state

async def save_unified_context(state: BSADeepAgentState) -> None:
    """Save DeepAgents conversation to unified memory system"""
    conversation_data = {
        "user_id": state["contractor_id"],
        "session_id": state["session_id"],
        "agent_type": "BSA_DEEPAGENTS",
        "messages": state["messages"],

        "analysis": {
            "bid_cards": state.get("bid_card_analysis"),
            "market_research": state.get("market_research")
        }
    }
    await save_unified_conversation(conversation_data)
```

### **Context Restoration**
```python
# On session start, restore full context including sub-agent work
async def restore_bsa_context(contractor_id: str, session_id: str) -> BSADeepAgentState:
    """Restore full BSA context including previous sub-agent analysis"""

## 🧪 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Unit Testing**
```python
# Test each sub-agent independently
async def test_bid_card_search_subagent():
    """Test bid card search sub-agent functionality"""
    agent = create_bid_card_search_specialist()
    result = await agent.ainvoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Find kitchen remodel projects in Seattle"}]
    })
    assert "bid_cards" in result
    assert len(result["bid_cards"]) > 0

async def test_bid_submission_subagent():
    """Test bid submission sub-agent functionality"""
    agent = create_bid_submission_specialist()
    result = await agent.ainvoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I can do this kitchen for $45k in 8 weeks"}]
    })
    assert "structured_bid" in result
    assert result["structured_bid"]["amount"] == 45000
```

### **Integration Testing**
```python
async def test_bsa_deepagents_full_workflow():
    """Test complete BSA DeepAgents workflow"""
    
    # Test bid card search + submission workflow
    request = {
        "contractor_id": "test-contractor-123",
        "message": "I'm looking for kitchen projects to bid on",
        "session_id": "test-session-456"
    }
    
    # Call main endpoint
    response = await bsa_deepagents_stream_endpoint(request)
    
    # Verify sub-agents were called
    assert "Found 3 kitchen projects" in response
    assert "sub_agent_calls" in response_state
    assert len(response_state["sub_agent_calls"]) >= 1
    
    # Verify memory persistence
    restored_state = await restore_bsa_context("test-contractor-123", "test-session-456")
    assert restored_state["bid_card_analysis"] is not None
```

### **Performance Testing**
```python
async def test_response_time_requirements():
    """Ensure <5 second response time maintained"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    response = await bsa_deepagents_stream_endpoint(test_request)
    first_byte_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert first_byte_time < 5.0  # Must maintain <5 second requirement
    
async def test_memory_loading_performance():
    """Ensure context loading stays under 2 seconds"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    context = await load_contractor_context_async("test-contractor")
    load_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert load_time < 2.0
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

### **Phased Rollout**

#### **Phase 1: Development Environment**
- Build and test new DeepAgents BSA in isolated environment
- Validate API compatibility and performance
- Complete memory integration testing

#### **Phase 2: Staging Environment** 
- Deploy alongside existing BSA for A/B testing
- Route 10% of traffic to DeepAgents version
- Monitor performance and error rates

#### **Phase 3: Production Rollout**
- Gradually increase traffic to DeepAgents BSA
- Monitor sub-agent performance and response times
- Full cutover once 100% validation achieved

### **Rollback Plan**
- Keep existing `bsa_stream.py` as fallback
- Feature flag to instantly revert to simple streaming
- Database rollback procedures for memory integration

---

## 📋 **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Performance Degradation**: Sub-agent calls may increase response time
  - *Mitigation*: Parallel sub-agent execution, performance monitoring
- **Memory Integration Complexity**: DeepAgents state + unified memory
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing, gradual rollout
- **API Compatibility**: Changes may break existing frontend  
  - *Mitigation*: Strict API contract maintenance, automated testing

### **Business Risks**
- **User Experience Impact**: Complex workflows may confuse contractors
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain simple conversation interface, hide complexity
- **Development Timeline**: Complex integration may exceed timeline
  - *Mitigation*: Phased approach, MVP first with advanced features later

### **Operational Risks**
- **DeepAgents Framework Dependency**: External framework dependency
  - *Mitigation*: Framework is fully local, no external dependencies
- **Sub-Agent Reliability**: Specialized agents may fail
  - *Mitigation*: Graceful degradation, fallback to main agent

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION**

This migration plan provides a systematic approach to upgrading the BSA from a simple streaming solution to a sophisticated DeepAgents-powered system with specialized sub-agents, while maintaining 100% API compatibility and performance requirements.

The phased approach ensures minimal risk and maximum validation at each step, with the ability to rollback if needed. The result will be a significantly more capable BSA that can provide trade expertise, bid card integration, market research, and advanced bidding strategies while maintaining the fast, responsive user experience contractors expect.

**Success depends on**:
1. Strict API compatibility maintenance
2. Performance requirement adherence (<5 seconds)
3. Thorough unified memory integration
4. Comprehensive testing at each phase
5. Gradual, monitored deployment approach

The sophisticated sub-agent system will provide the foundation for advanced BSA capabilities while preserving the simplicity and speed that makes the current system effective.
