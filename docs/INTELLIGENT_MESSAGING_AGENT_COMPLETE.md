## 🧠 Core Intelligence Classes

### **GPT5SecurityAnalyzer** (Lines 56-585)
The AI brain that analyzes all content for security threats:

```python
class GPT5SecurityAnalyzer:
    """GPT-5 powered security analysis engine"""
    
    async def analyze_message_security(content, sender_type, project_context, conversation_history)
        # Returns comprehensive security analysis with threats, confidence, and recommendations
        
    async def analyze_image_content(image_data, image_format)
        # Analyzes images for embedded contact information
        
    async def analyze_pdf_content(pdf_data, filename)
        # Extracts and analyzes PDF text for security threats
```

**Key Features**:
- Uses GPT-4o (falls back from GPT-5 which isn't available yet)
- Detects 30+ types of contact info bypass attempts
- Analyzes images for embedded phone numbers/emails
- Processes PDFs for hidden contact information
- Context-aware analysis using conversation history

### **Security Threats Detected**:
```python
class SecurityThreat(str, Enum):
    CONTACT_INFO = "contact_info"        # Phone, email, address
    SOCIAL_MEDIA = "social_media"        # Instagram, Facebook, etc
    EXTERNAL_MEETING = "external_meeting" # "Let's meet for coffee"
    PAYMENT_BYPASS = "payment_bypass"     # Venmo, Cash, PayPal
    PLATFORM_BYPASS = "platform_bypass"   # Any attempt to go off-platform
```

### **Project Scope Changes Detected**:
```python
class ProjectScopeChange(str, Enum):
    MATERIAL_CHANGE = "material_change"     # "granite instead of quartz"
    SIZE_CHANGE = "size_change"             # "make it bigger"
    FEATURE_ADDITION = "feature_addition"   # "also add a pergola"
    FEATURE_REMOVAL = "feature_removal"     # "skip the fence"
    TIMELINE_CHANGE = "timeline_change"     # "need it done sooner"
    BUDGET_CHANGE = "budget_change"         # "increase budget to $20k"
```
