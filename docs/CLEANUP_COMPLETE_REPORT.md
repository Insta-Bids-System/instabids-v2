   - **Configured API key**: `AIzaSyBacJk_H4rpExmLiG1g8-nAGZJbSgC3IaA`
   - **Authentic business research capabilities**

2. **`agents/coia/unified_graph.py`** ✅ KEPT (910 lines, cleaned)
   - **Real LangGraph workflow system**
   - **Multiple interface support (landing, chat, research, intelligence)**
   - **Mock data functions removed, now fails cleanly**

3. **`routers/unified_coia_api.py`** ✅ KEPT (777 lines) 
   - **Complete REST API with all endpoints**
   - **Includes missing `/api/coia/landing` endpoint**
   - **Real MCP tool integrations**

4. **`routers/coia_api.py`** ✅ VERIFIED CLEAN (current system)

## 🔧 CURRENT WORKING SYSTEM

### **What's Currently Connected**:
- **Main Router**: `routers/coia_api.py` (clean, simple COIA system)
- **Backend**: Starts up cleanly with no errors ✅
- **Health Check**: `/api/coia/health` responds properly ✅
- **Endpoints**: `/api/coia/chat` and `/api/coia/chat/stream` available ✅

### **System Capabilities After Cleanup**:
- ✅ **Real business name extraction** (no hardcoded responses)
- ✅ **Clean conversation flow** (no fake data injection)
- ✅ **Proper error handling** (fails cleanly, no fake fallbacks)
- ✅ **Session persistence** (real database integration)

## 🚨 WHAT WAS REMOVED FOREVER

### **Fake Data Patterns Eliminated**:
- ❌ `"(561) 555-TURF"` fake phone numbers
- ❌ `"TurfGrass Artificial Solutions"` hardcoded company
- ❌ Fake Google ratings and review counts
- ❌ Mock business addresses and websites
- ❌ Hardcoded service specialties and certifications

### **Deceptive Behavior Eliminated**:
- ❌ Fake contractor profile generation
- ❌ Mock business research results
- ❌ Hardcoded "turfgrass" company responses
- ❌ Fallback fake data when APIs fail
- ❌ Any code that could mislead about capabilities

## 🎯 SOPHISTICATED REAL SYSTEMS AVAILABLE

**The cleanup revealed that extensive real systems exist but have dependency issues:**

1. **Real Google Places API System**: Ready but needs clean import paths
2. **LangGraph Workflow**: Sophisticated but needs tools.py restructure  
3. **Complete REST API**: Full endpoint coverage but needs dependency cleanup

**These can be connected once import dependencies are resolved without fake tools.**
