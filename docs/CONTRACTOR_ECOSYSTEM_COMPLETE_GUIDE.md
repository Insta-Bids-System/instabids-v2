## üéØ AGENT-SPECIFIC INTEGRATION GUIDE

### **Agent 1 (Frontend) Integration**
```typescript
// Contractor Management Interface
interface UnifiedContractor {
  // Core platform data (17 fields from contractors table)
  id: string;
  user_id?: string;
  company_name: string;
  rating?: number;
  verified: boolean;
  tier: 1 | 2 | 3;
  
  // Rich discovery data (49 fields from contractor_leads table)  
  contact_name?: string;
  phone?: string;
  email?: string;
  website?: string;
  specialties: string[];
  certifications: string[];
  years_in_business?: number;
  license_verified: boolean;
  // ... all 49 fields available
}
```

### **Agent 2 (Backend) Current Implementation**
- ‚úÖ Built contractor management API with 3-tier classification
- ‚úÖ Handles complex data merging from contractors + contractor_leads tables  
- ‚úÖ Provides real-time contractor statistics and filtering
- ‚è≥ Ready to simplify once Agent 4 completes table unification

### **Agent 4 (Contractor UX) Integration Target**
```sql
-- Target unified contractors table structure
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN contact_name varchar;
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN phone varchar;
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN email varchar;
ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN website text;
-- ... add all 49 contractor_leads fields

-- Result: Single table with 66 fields for complete contractor profiles
```

### **Agent 6 (QA) Testing Requirements**
- Test contractor table unification without breaking existing functionality
- Verify all 14 tables maintain referential integrity
- Performance testing with unified 66-field contractor table
- End-to-end campaign management workflow testing

2. **Automated Escalation** - Intelligent campaign optimization
3. **Contractor Relationship Management** - Long-term contractor performance tracking

---

## üìã CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **Data Integrity Requirements**
- Maintain all foreign key relationships during table unification
- Preserve contractor discovery pipeline functionality
- Ensure campaign tracking remains uninterrupted

### **Performance Considerations**
- Index optimization for unified contractors table
- Query performance testing with 66-field table structure  
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed contractor data

### **Integration Checkpoints**
- [ ] Agent 4 completes contractor table unification
- [ ] Agent 2 updates API to use unified table
- [ ] Agent 1 implements rich contractor profiles  
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete contractor lifecycle
- [ ] Manual campaign management interface deployment
