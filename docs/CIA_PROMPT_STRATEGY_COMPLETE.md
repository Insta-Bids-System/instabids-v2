## 🧩 FIELD EXTRACTION INTELLIGENCE

- deadline_hard: true
- deadline_context: "before my wedding"
```

User: "I want to modernize my kitchen - cabinets, countertops, appliances"
CIA Extracts:
- project_type: "kitchen"
- service_type: "renovation"  
- project_name: "Kitchen Renovation"
- materials: ["cabinets", "countertops", "appliances"]
```

#### **Budget Context Extraction:**
```
User: "My budget is around $45,000 to $60,000"
CIA Extracts:
- budget_min: 45000
- budget_max: 60000
- budget_context: "researched range for quality work"
```

#### **Group Bidding Detection:**
```
User: "My neighbor is also planning a kitchen remodel"
CIA Triggers:
- group_bidding_opportunity: true
- Immediately highlights: "15-25% ADDITIONAL savings!"

## 🧠 THE CIA'S DECISION-MAKING LOGIC

### **When User Mentions Additional Work:**
1. **CONTINUATION**: Adding to existing project → Update current bid card
2. **NEW PROJECT**: Separate work → Create new bid card  
3. **UNCLEAR**: Ask for clarification → "Would you like to add this to your current project or create a separate bid card?"

### **Contractor Tier Recommendation Logic:**
```
Emergency + Any Budget → Tier 1 (Speed Priority)
Quality Focus + High Budget → Tier 3-4 (Quality Priority)  
Standard Project + Moderate Budget → Tier 2-3 (Balance)
Simple Repair + Low Budget → Tier 1-2 (Value Priority)
Group Bidding Opportunity → Multi-Tier (Competitive)
```

### **Timeline Strategy Logic:**
```
Same Day → Skip details, prioritize speed
1-3 Days → Balance speed vs. details
1-2 Weeks → Collect comprehensive information  
3+ Weeks → PUSH GROUP BIDDING HARD
Flexible → Maximum group bidding promotion
```
