# Orchestration & Timing System - Backend Intelligence Engine

## Overview
The Orchestration & Timing System is the mathematical intelligence engine that coordinates the entire backend workflow. Unlike other agents that use LLMs, this system uses pure mathematical formulas and business rules to calculate contractor outreach strategies, monitor campaign progress, and trigger escalations.

## Core Technology
- **Mathematical Engine**: Pure business logic calculations (no LLMs)
- **5/10/15 Rule**: Response rate calculations (90%/50%/33% by tier)
- **Database**: Supabase for campaign tracking and contractor availability
- **State Management**: Progress monitoring at 25%, 50%, 75% checkpoints
- **Escalation Logic**: Automatic contractor addition when below targets

## Key Components

### ðŸ§® Timing & Probability Engine
**File**: `agents/orchestration/timing_probability_engine.py`
**Role**: Calculates how many contractors to contact based on mathematical formulas

#### Contractor Calculation Algorithm
```python
def calculate_contractors_needed(self, bids_needed: int, timeline_hours: int):
    # Response rate by tier (historical business data)
    response_rates = {1: 0.90, 2: 0.50, 3: 0.33}
    
    # Buffer multiplier based on timeline urgency
    urgency_multipliers = {
        "emergency": 1.5,   # Need extra contractors for speed
        "urgent": 1.3,      # Moderate buffer
        "standard": 1.1,    # Small buffer
        "flexible": 1.0     # No buffer needed
    }
    
    # Calculate contractors needed per tier
    tier1_needed = min(available_tier1, math.ceil(bids_needed / response_rates[1]))
    tier2_needed = math.ceil(remaining_bids / response_rates[2])
    tier3_needed = math.ceil(final_remaining / response_rates[3])
```

#### Business Logic Examples
```
Example 1: Emergency Kitchen Remodel
- Timeline: 6 hours (emergency)
- Bids needed: 4
- Available: 8 Tier1, 12 Tier2, 50+ Tier3
- Calculation: 3 Tier1 + 5 Tier2 + 0 Tier3 = 8 contractors
- Expected responses: 4.4 (exceeds target)
- Confidence: 100%

Example 2: Standard Bathroom Project  
- Timeline: 2 weeks (standard)
- Bids needed: 4
- Available: 2 Tier1, 8 Tier2, 20 Tier3
- Calculation: 2 Tier1 + 4 Tier2 + 3 Tier3 = 9 contractors
- Expected responses: 4.1 (meets target)
- Confidence: 95%
```

### ðŸ“Š Check-In Manager
**File**: `agents/orchestration/check_in_manager.py`
**Role**: Monitors campaign progress and triggers escalations

#### Progress Monitoring System
```python
def create_check_ins(self, campaign_id: str, timeline_hours: int):
    check_in_times = [
        timeline_hours * 0.25,  # 25% checkpoint
        timeline_hours * 0.50,  # 50% checkpoint  
        timeline_hours * 0.75   # 75% checkpoint
    ]
    
    for time_point in check_in_times:
        schedule_check_in(campaign_id, time_point, "progress_review")
```

#### Escalation Triggers
- **25% Checkpoint**: Early warning if no responses
- **50% Checkpoint**: Add Tier 2 contractors if behind target
- **75% Checkpoint**: Emergency escalation - add Tier 3 contractors
- **90% Checkpoint**: Final push - contact backup contractors

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Campaign Orchestrator  
**File**: `agents/orchestration/enhanced_campaign_orchestrator.py`
**Role**: Integrates timing engine with actual campaign execution

#### Intelligent Campaign Creation
```python
async def create_intelligent_campaign(self, request: CampaignRequest):
    # 1. Calculate contractor strategy using timing engine
    strategy = self.timing_engine.calculate_outreach_strategy(
        timeline_hours=request.timeline_hours,
        bids_needed=request.bids_needed,
        project_location=request.location
    )
    
    # 2. Create database campaign record
    campaign = await self.create_campaign_record(strategy)
    
    # 3. Schedule check-ins at calculated intervals
    await self.check_in_manager.schedule_check_ins(campaign.id, strategy)
    
    # 4. Trigger contractor discovery (CDA)
    contractors = await self.discover_contractors(request, strategy)
    
    # 5. Launch outreach campaigns (EAA)
    await self.launch_outreach(campaign.id, contractors, request)
    
    return campaign
```

```

### Mathematical Workflow (No LLMs)
1. **Input Analysis**: Timeline, bids needed, location
2. **Contractor Calculation**: Mathematical formulas determine quantities
3. **Database Queries**: Check actual contractor availability  
4. **Strategy Generation**: Create execution plan with checkpoints
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Track against mathematical targets
6. **Escalation Logic**: Automatic adjustments when behind schedule

## Business Rules Implementation

### Tier-Based Response Rates
- **Tier 1 (Internal/Verified)**: 90% response rate
  - Existing InstaBids contractors
  - Verified licenses and insurance
  - Established platform relationships

- **Tier 2 (Re-engagement)**: 50% response rate  
  - Previously active contractors
  - Good historical performance
  - Temporary inactivity

- **Tier 3 (External/Cold)**: 33% response rate
  - Newly discovered contractors
  - Cold outreach required
  - Unknown platform familiarity

### Timeline-Based Strategies
```python
urgency_strategies = {
    "emergency": {
        "hours": 6,
        "tiers_used": [1, 2],          # Skip Tier 3 for speed
        "multiplier": 1.5,             # Extra contractors for urgency
        "check_in_frequency": 1.5      # Check every 1.5 hours
    },
    "urgent": {
        "hours": 24,
        "tiers_used": [1, 2, 3],
        "multiplier": 1.3,
        "check_in_frequency": 6        # Check every 6 hours  
    },
    "standard": {
        "hours": 168,                  # 1 week
        "tiers_used": [1, 2, 3],
        "multiplier": 1.1,
        "check_in_frequency": 24       # Daily check-ins
    }
}
```

## Database Integration

### Campaign Tracking Tables
- `outreach_campaigns` - Master campaign records
- `campaign_check_ins` - Scheduled progress checkpoints
- `campaign_contractors` - Contractor assignments per campaign
- `contractor_outreach_attempts` - Individual outreach tracking

### Real-Time Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check campaign progress at any time
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.bids_needed,
    c.contractors_targeted,
    COUNT(r.id) as responses_received,
    (COUNT(r.id)::float / c.bids_needed * 100) as progress_percentage
FROM outreach_campaigns c
LEFT JOIN contractor_responses r ON c.id = r.campaign_id
WHERE c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.id;
```
