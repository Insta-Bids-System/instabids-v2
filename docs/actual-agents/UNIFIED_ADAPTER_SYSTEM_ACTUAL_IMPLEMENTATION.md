## ðŸ”„ ACTUAL INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### **How Agents Actually Use Adapters:**

#### **CIA Agent Integration:**
```python
from adapters.homeowner_context import HomeownerContextAdapter

adapter = HomeownerContextAdapter()
context = adapter.get_full_agent_context(user_id=user_id, bid_card_id=bid_card_id)

# CIA gets complete access to:
# - All user bid cards and projects
# - Full conversation history
# - Complete homeowner profile data
# - Cross-project memory and preferences
```

#### **COIA Agent Integration:**
```python
from adapters.contractor_context import ContractorContextAdapter

adapter = ContractorContextAdapter()
context = adapter.get_contractor_context(contractor_id=contractor_id)

# COIA gets privacy-filtered access to:
# - Available projects (homeowners show as "Project Owner")
# - Bid submission and tracking
# - Campaign and outreach history
# - Filtered messaging context
```

#### **Messaging Agent Integration:**
```python
from adapters.messaging_context import MessagingContextAdapter

adapter = MessagingContextAdapter()
filtered_message = adapter.apply_message_filtering(
    message=message,
    sender_side="homeowner", 
    recipient_side="contractor"
)

# Results in automatic PII filtering:
# - "Call me at 555-1234" â†’ "Call me at [PHONE REMOVED]"
# - "John Smith" â†’ "Project Owner"
```

#### **IRIS Agent Integration:**
```python
from adapters.iris_context import IrisContextAdapter

adapter = IrisContextAdapter()
context = adapter.get_inspiration_context(user_id=user_id, project_id=project_id)

# IRIS gets unified memory access to:
# - Inspiration boards stored in unified_conversation_memory
# - Design preferences across projects
# - Photos and attachments from unified system
# - Context from CIA and messaging agents
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIVACY FILTERING IN ACTION

### **Cross-Side Privacy Examples:**

#### **Homeowner Data as Seen by Contractors:**
```python
# Original homeowner data:
{
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@email.com", 
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "address": "123 Main St"
}

# After contractor_context adapter filtering:
{
    "name": "Project Owner",
    "email": "[EMAIL REMOVED]",
    "phone": "[PHONE REMOVED]", 
    "address": "[ADDRESS FILTERED]"
}
```

#### **Message Filtering Example:**
```python
# Original message from homeowner:
"Hi there! I'm John Smith at 555-1234. Email me at john@email.com"

# After messaging_context adapter filtering:
"Hi there! I'm [NAME REMOVED] at [PHONE REMOVED]. Email me at [EMAIL REMOVED]"

# With sender alias:
{
    "content": "Hi there! I'm [NAME REMOVED] at [PHONE REMOVED]. Email me at [EMAIL REMOVED]",
    "sender_name": "Project Owner"
}
```

## âœ… VERIFICATION OF ADAPTER SYSTEM

### **Production Usage Confirmed:**
1. âœ… **CIA Agent** actively uses HomeownerContextAdapter for all database access
2. âœ… **COIA Agent** uses ContractorContextAdapter for privacy-filtered project access  
3. âœ… **Messaging Agent** uses MessagingContextAdapter for cross-side communication
4. âœ… **IRIS Agent** uses IrisContextAdapter with proper unified memory integration

### **Privacy Filtering Verified:**
1. âœ… **PII Removal Working** - Phone, email, address filtering operational
2. âœ… **Name Aliasing Working** - Contractors become "Contractor A", homeowners become "Project Owner"
3. âœ… **Cross-Side Isolation** - Homeowner agents cannot see contractor PII and vice versa
4. âœ… **Same-Side Sharing** - Homeowner agents (CIA, IRIS) share full context

### **Business Functionality Verified:**
1. âœ… **Complete Contractor Lifecycle** - 663 lines of comprehensive contractor operations
2. âœ… **Full Homeowner Management** - 391 lines of complete CIA integration
3. âœ… **Cross-Agent Coordination** - IRIS properly integrates with CIA conversation data
4. âœ… **Real-Time Messaging** - Cross-side communication with privacy filtering
