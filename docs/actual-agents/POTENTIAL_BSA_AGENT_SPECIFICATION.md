# Potential Bid Submission Agent (BSA) - Complete Specification

**Agent ID**: BSA (Potential Agent 7)  
**Purpose**: Specialized AI agent for converting contractor input into standardized bid submissions  
**Status**: Research & Design Phase  
**Priority**: High (Critical for contractor adoption and platform differentiation)  
**Integration**: Works alongside COIA (Agent 4) similar to IRIS-CIA pattern

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Problem
Contractors abandon InstaBids because our standardized bid forms don't match their natural workflows. Different trades think about projects completely differently - a landscaper talks about zones and seasons, while an electrician thinks about circuits and code compliance. Our current "one-size-fits-all" form forces contractors into an unnatural process.

### The Solution
BSA acts as an intelligent translation layer that lets contractors input bids naturally (voice, text, PDFs, images) and automatically converts their expertise into professional InstaBids proposals. Think of it as a specialized interpreter that speaks each trade's language fluently.

### Business Impact
- **Target**: 75%+ increase in bid submission rates
- **Efficiency**: Reduce submission time from 15+ minutes to under 5 minutes  
- **Quality**: Generate professional proposals that match manual submissions
- **Differentiation**: Become the most contractor-friendly platform in the market

## PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

### 1. USER PERSONAS & PAIN POINTS

#### Primary: Mid-Size Contractor (5-15 years experience)
**Current Pain Points:**
- "Your form doesn't match how I think about pricing"
- "It takes me 20 minutes to fill out what I could explain in 2 minutes"
- "I have to translate my estimate into your categories"

**BSA Solution:**
- Voice input: "Kitchen remodel, 300 sq ft, granite counters, custom cabs, 65k, 8 weeks"
- BSA converts to: Complete professional proposal with timeline, materials, approach

#### Secondary: Large Contractor with Systems
**Current Pain Points:**
- "I already have estimates in QuickBooks/Buildertrend"
- "Why do I need to re-enter data I already have?"
- "Your categories don't match my business structure"

**BSA Solution:**
- PDF upload of existing estimate
- BSA extracts and maps to InstaBids format
- Maintains contractor's branding and approach

### 2. CORE FUNCTIONALITY

- Deep contractor interviews for each trade
- Iterative refinement based on usage patterns
- Trade-specific expert consultants

#### 3. Integration Complexity with COIA
**Risk**: BSA-COIA coordination becomes overly complex
**Impact**: System reliability issues, maintenance burden
**Mitigation**:
- Clear API contracts and boundaries
- Fallback to standalone BSA mode
- Extensive integration testing
- Simple, well-defined data sharing protocols

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 4. Contractor Adoption Resistance
