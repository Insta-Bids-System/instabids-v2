# Complete Image Integration Checklist

**Current Status**: Images upload to bucket ‚úÖ | Everything else needs integration üîß

## üî¥ BACKEND INTEGRATION NEEDED

### 1. CIA Agent - Image Analysis (`ai-agents/agents/cia/agent.py`)
**Current**: CIA doesn't analyze uploaded images
**Needed**: 
```python
# When images are uploaded, CIA needs to:
1. Receive image URLs from upload endpoint
2. Call Claude Vision API to analyze images
3. Extract project details from visual analysis
4. Update potential bid card with findings
5. Store analysis in conversation memory
```
**Files to modify**:
- `agents/cia/agent.py` - Add vision analysis capability
- `agents/cia/prompts.py` - Add image analysis prompts
- `agents/cia/state.py` - Add image_urls and image_analyses fields

### 2. Homeowner Context Adapter (`ai-agents/adapters/homeowner_context.py`)
**Current**: Doesn't handle image URLs
**Needed**:
```python
# Context adapter needs to:
1. Retrieve image URLs from potential bid cards
2. Pass URLs to CIA agent for context
3. Include image descriptions in conversation context
4. NOT pass base64 data (only URLs)
```

### 3. Unified Conversation Memory (`ai-agents/memory/unified_conversation_memory.py`)
**Current**: May not store image references
**Needed**:
```python
# Memory system needs to:
1. Store image URLs in conversation memory
2. Store image analysis results
3. Retrieve images for context in new sessions
4. Link images to specific projects
```

### 4. CIA Routes (`ai-agents/routers/cia_routes_unified.py`)
**Current**: Doesn't integrate image uploads with conversation
**Needed**:
```python
# Router needs to:
1. Accept image URLs in chat requests
2. Pass images to CIA agent for analysis
3. Return image analyses in responses
4. Update potential bid card with image data
```

### 5. Potential Bid Card Manager (`ai-agents/agents/cia/potential_bid_card_integration.py`)
**Current**: May not handle photo_ids field properly
**Needed**:
```python
# Manager needs to:
1. Store image URLs in photo_ids field
2. Link images to bid card
3. Track which images have been analyzed
4. Update completion percentage based on images
```

## üî¥ FRONTEND INTEGRATION NEEDED

### 6. CIA Chat Component (`web/src/components/chat/UltimateCIAChat.tsx`)
**Current**: Doesn't display uploaded images
**Needed**:
```typescript
// Chat component needs to:
1. Show image upload button
2. Display uploaded images in chat
3. Show "Analyzing image..." status
4. Display image analysis results
5. Show images in bid card preview
```

### 7. Potential Bid Card Display (`web/src/components/bidcards/PotentialBidCardView.tsx`)
**Current**: May not display images from URLs
**Needed**:
```typescript
// Component needs to:
1. Fetch images from photo_ids field
2. Display images in carousel/gallery
3. Show image captions
4. Handle image loading states
5. Link to full-size images
```

### 8. Bid Card Preview in Chat (`web/src/components/chat/BidCardPreview.tsx`)
**Current**: Doesn't show images
**Needed**:
```typescript
// Preview needs to:
1. Show thumbnail images
2. Display image count badge
3. Link to full bid card with images
4. Show "Images attached" indicator
```

### 9. Homeowner Dashboard (`web/src/pages/HomeownerDashboard.tsx`)
**Current**: May not show bid cards with images
**Needed**:
```typescript
// Dashboard needs to:
1. Show bid card thumbnails with images
2. Display image count per bid card
3. Filter/sort by bid cards with images
4. Show image gallery view
```

## üî¥ API INTEGRATION NEEDED

### 10. Vision API Integration (`ai-agents/api/vision.py`)
**Current**: May exist but not connected to CIA
**Needed**:
```python
# Vision API needs to:
1. Accept image URLs (not base64)
2. Call Claude Vision API
3. Return structured analysis
4. Handle multiple images
5. Cache analysis results
```

### 11. Image Analysis Pipeline
**Flow needed**:
```
1. User uploads image ‚Üí Bucket storage ‚úÖ
2. URL saved to potential_bid_card.photo_ids ‚úÖ
3. CIA agent notified of new image ‚ùå
4. Vision API analyzes image ‚ùå
5. Analysis updates bid card fields ‚ùå
6. Chat shows analysis results ‚ùå
7. Memory stores image context ‚ùå
8. Next session remembers images ‚ùå
```

## üî¥ DATABASE UPDATES NEEDED

### 12. Schema Additions
```sql
-- May need to add to potential_bid_cards:
ALTER TABLE potential_bid_cards ADD COLUMN image_analyses JSONB;
ALTER TABLE potential_bid_cards ADD COLUMN images_analyzed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- May need to add to unified_conversation_memory:
ALTER TABLE unified_conversation_memory ADD COLUMN image_urls JSONB;
ALTER TABLE unified_conversation_memory ADD COLUMN image_analyses JSONB;
```

## üß™ TESTING NEEDED

### 13. End-to-End Test Scenarios
1. **Upload Test**: User uploads 3 photos ‚Üí All save to bucket
2. **Analysis Test**: CIA analyzes images ‚Üí Extracts project details
3. **Display Test**: Images show in chat ‚Üí Bid card preview ‚Üí Full bid card
4. **Memory Test**: New session ‚Üí CIA remembers previous images
5. **Context Test**: User asks "what about that crack in the photo?" ‚Üí CIA knows

### 14. Integration Test Points
- [ ] Image upload returns URL
- [ ] URL saved to potential_bid_card
- [ ] CIA receives image URL
- [ ] Vision API analyzes image
- [ ] Analysis updates bid card
- [ ] Chat displays image
- [ ] Bid card shows image
- [ ] Memory preserves image
- [ ] Context includes image
