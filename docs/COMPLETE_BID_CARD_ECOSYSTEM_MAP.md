## 📊 DATA FLOW ANALYSIS

### **Real Bid Card Example Analysis**
**Bid Card**: `BC-TEST-1754075991` (Emergency bathroom remodel)
- **Status**: `bids_complete` ✅
- **Target**: 4 contractors needed
- **Results**: 4 bids received (100% success)
- **Campaign**: 6 contractors targeted, 4 responses received
- **Timeline**: Emergency (completed same day)

### **Key Data Patterns Discovered**
1. **Bid Storage**: Actual bids stored as JSONB in `bid_cards.bid_document.submitted_bids`
2. **Campaign Efficiency**: Campaign targeted 6 contractors, got 4 responses (67% response rate)
3. **Status Automation**: Status automatically changed to `bids_complete` when target met
4. **No Outreach Records**: `contractor_outreach_attempts` empty - likely test data bypassed outreach
5. **Direct Bid Submission**: Bids submitted via API/website forms, not email responses

## 🎯 BID CARD DASHBOARD DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Based on the complete schema analysis, the bid card dashboard should display:

### **BID CARD LIST VIEW**
```javascript
// Query for dashboard overview
SELECT 
  bc.bid_card_number,
  bc.project_type,
  bc.status,
  bc.contractor_count_needed,
  bc.created_at,
  oc.contractors_targeted,
  oc.responses_received,
  (bc.bid_document->'bids_received_count')::int as bids_received
FROM bid_cards bc
LEFT JOIN outreach_campaigns oc ON bc.id = oc.bid_card_id
ORDER BY bc.created_at DESC;
```

### **BID CARD DETAIL VIEW**
1. **Header Section**: Project info, status timeline, progress metrics
2. **Discovery Section**: `contractor_discovery_cache` + `potential_contractors` data  
3. **Campaign Section**: `outreach_campaigns` + `campaign_check_ins` progress
4. **Outreach Section**: `contractor_outreach_attempts` with channel breakdown
5. **Engagement Section**: `bid_card_views` + `bid_card_engagement_events`
6. **Bids Section**: Parse `bid_document.submitted_bids` for submitted bids
7. **Follow-up Section**: `followup_attempts` + `manual_followup_tasks`

### **Real-Time Updates**
- **WebSocket Integration**: Listen for changes to bid_cards table
- **Status Changes**: Auto-update when bids submitted or status changes
- **Campaign Progress**: Live updates from campaign_check_ins
- **Engagement Tracking**: Real-time view and interaction tracking
