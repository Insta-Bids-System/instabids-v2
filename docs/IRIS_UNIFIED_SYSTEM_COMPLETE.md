# IRIS Agent - Unified Memory System Integration Complete
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY  
**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Verification**: Database tested with real data

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The IRIS (Inspiration & Recommendation Intelligence System) agent is now fully integrated with the unified conversation memory system. All image operations (save and retrieve) properly use the unified tables instead of legacy tables.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **IrisContextAdapter** - Properly Queries Unified Tables
- ✅ Queries `unified_conversations` for user conversations
- ✅ Queries `unified_conversation_memory` for photo references  
- ✅ Properly handles UUID validation
- ✅ Returns privacy-filtered data for IRIS agent

### 2. **ImagePersistenceService** - Updated for Unified System
- ✅ New `save_to_unified_memory()` method saves to correct table
- ✅ Updates `unified_conversation_memory` instead of legacy `inspiration_images`
- ✅ Properly structures image data with metadata
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility for storage operations

### 3. **IRIS Agent** - Complete Save/Retrieve Methods
- ✅ New `save_inspiration_image()` method for saving images
- ✅ New `retrieve_inspiration_images()` method for retrieval
- ✅ Handles temporary URL conversion to permanent storage
- ✅ Uses adapter pattern for all data access (no direct DB queries)

## 📊 Database Verification

### Test Data Created and Verified:
```sql
-- Conversation created
ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002
Type: iris_inspiration
Title: Test IRIS Kitchen Inspiration

-- Images saved to unified_conversation_memory
1. iris_kitchen_inspiration_001 - Kitchen with modern farmhouse style
2. iris_bathroom_inspiration_002 - Spa-like bathroom inspiration  
3. iris_backyard_inspiration_003 - Outdoor backyard with pool
```

### Verified Query Results:
```json
{
  "memory_key": "iris_kitchen_inspiration_001",
  "memory_value": {
    "images": [{
      "url": "https://supabase.storage/iris-images/kitchen-modern-001.jpg",
      "metadata": {
        "category": "inspiration",
        "room_type": "kitchen",
        "style": "modern farmhouse",
        "elements": ["white cabinets", "black hardware", "subway tile backsplash"]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Complete Image Flow

### Save Flow:
```
1. User uploads image to IRIS
   ↓
2. IRIS Agent receives image URL
   ↓
3. If temporary (OpenAI), download & store permanently
   ↓
4. Call ImagePersistenceService.save_to_unified_memory()
   ↓
5. Insert into unified_conversation_memory table
   ↓
6. Return memory_id and permanent URL
```

### Retrieve Flow:
```
1. IRIS Agent needs images for user
   ↓
2. Call IrisContextAdapter.get_inspiration_context()
   ↓
3. Adapter queries unified_conversations for user
   ↓
4. Adapter queries unified_conversation_memory for photos
   ↓
5. Return categorized photos (project/inspiration/attachments)
   ↓
6. IRIS presents images to user
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Old System (Legacy):
- **Table**: `inspiration_images`
- **Problem**: Isolated from unified conversation system
- **Issue**: No cross-agent visibility

### New System (Unified):
- **Table**: `unified_conversation_memory`
- **Benefit**: Full cross-agent visibility
- **Advantage**: Consistent with all other agents

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### 1. **ImagePersistenceService** (`services/image_persistence_service.py`)
```python
# NEW METHOD ADDED
async def save_to_unified_memory(
    conversation_id: str, 
    image_url: str,
    image_path: str,
    metadata: dict
) -> str:
    """Save image to unified conversation memory"""
    # Saves to unified_conversation_memory instead of inspiration_images
```

### 2. **IRIS Agent** (`agents/iris/agent.py`)
```python
# NEW METHODS ADDED
async def save_inspiration_image(
    conversation_id: str,
    image_url: str,
    image_metadata: dict
) -> dict:
    """Save image using unified system"""

async def retrieve_inspiration_images(
    user_id: str,
    project_id: str = None
) -> list:
    """Retrieve images from unified system"""
```

### 3. **IrisContextAdapter** (`adapters/iris_context.py`)
- Updated all queries to use unified tables
- Fixed column name mismatches
- Added UUID validation

## 📋 Testing & Verification

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Save single image to unified memory
- ✅ Save multiple images with different metadata
- ✅ Retrieve images by user ID
- ✅ Retrieve images by conversation ID
- ✅ Handle temporary URL conversion
- ✅ Verify cross-agent visibility

### Production Readiness Checklist:
- [x] READ operations working through adapter
- [x] WRITE operations save to unified tables
- [x] No direct database queries in IRIS agent
- [x] Proper UUID format handling
- [x] Metadata structure consistent
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Logging for debugging
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Save an Image:
```python
from agents.iris.agent import iris_agent

result = await iris_agent.save_inspiration_image(
    conversation_id="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
    image_url="https://example.com/kitchen.jpg",
    image_metadata={
        "room_type": "kitchen",
        "style": "modern",
        "category": "inspiration"
    }
)
# Returns: {"success": True, "memory_id": "...", "permanent_url": "..."}
```

### Retrieve Images:
```python
images = await iris_agent.retrieve_inspiration_images(
    user_id="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
)
# Returns: List of image dictionaries with URLs and metadata
```

## 🔍 Key Benefits

1. **Cross-Agent Visibility**: Other agents can now see IRIS-saved images
2. **Unified Memory**: Consistent storage pattern across all agents
3. **Privacy Compliance**: Adapter pattern ensures data filtering
4. **Production Ready**: Fully tested with real database operations
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Ready for additional image features

## 📈 Impact on Other Agents

- **CIA Agent**: Can reference IRIS inspiration images in conversations
- **JAA Agent**: Can include inspiration photos in bid cards
- **HMA Agent**: Can access all user's design inspirations
- **CMA Agent**: Can filter messages about specific inspiration images

## ✅ Final Status

**PRODUCTION READY** - The IRIS agent is fully integrated with the unified memory system:
- All READ operations use unified tables ✅
- All WRITE operations save to unified tables ✅  
- Legacy table dependencies removed ✅
- Cross-agent data sharing enabled ✅
- Database operations verified with real data ✅

The system is ready for production use with complete image management capabilities through the unified conversation memory architecture.
