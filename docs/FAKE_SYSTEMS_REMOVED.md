# FAKE SYSTEMS REMOVED - BACKUP RECORD

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Action**: Systematic removal of all fake/deceptive contractor code

## Files Backed Up and Removed:

### 1. `agents/coia/tools.py` - FAKE DATA SYSTEM
**Problem**: Contains hardcoded fake data:
- "(561) 555-TURF" phone numbers
- Fake addresses and ratings
- Hardcoded responses for "turfgrass" company
- Deceptive business information

### 2. `agents/coia/simple_research_agent.py` - MOCK DATA GENERATOR  
**Problem**: Creates fake research data instead of real web research:
- `_create_mock_research_data()` function
- Placeholder responses instead of real API calls
- Mock business profiles

### 3. `routers/coia_api_fixed.py` - FAKE SYSTEM ROUTER
**Problem**: Imports and uses the fake tools:
- Imports `agents.coia.tools` (fake system)
- Routes fake responses to real API endpoints
- Currently connected to main.py (the deception layer)

## Real Systems That Remain:
- `agents/coia/intelligent_research_agent.py` - Real Google Places API
- `agents/coia/unified_graph.py` - Real LangGraph workflow  
- `routers/unified_coia_api.py` - Real REST API with all endpoints

**These fake systems have been completely removed to prevent any future deception.**
